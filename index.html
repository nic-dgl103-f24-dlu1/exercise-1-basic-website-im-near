        <h1>Questions and answers</h1>
        <h2> 
        <p>Who are you? My name is Near, and I'm just an average person enrolled in online courses to learn more about basic coding!</p>
        <p>I this your first time in post-secondary education, if no, what did you study? Yes! this is my first time in post-secondary, so I can't answer that second part well.</p> 
        <p>Do you have past experience with creating webstites? if yes, please explain. Yep! I created a few forum sites back in my youth, for the game Socom: US Navy Seals Fireteam Bravo. These were just for likeminded individuals in the game, and pretty basic using a preset template.</p>
        <p>Do you know any coding languages? If yes, which ones? I wouldn't say that I <b>know</b> languages, but I am familiar with quite a few!</p>
        <p>What are your goals for this course. Honestly, I find it best to set your expectations low so that you can go from there. So I pretty much just have the goals to pass this course so that I can move on with the rest of my courses, but it would be great if I could excel in it. Of course, all of the learning done along the way is a huge plus as well!</p>
